** Attributes

Currently attributes are:
- Xml.Attr nodes inside their Xml.Node
- in a GXml.Node, we keep a proxy GLib.HashTable as our DOM's NamedNodeMap
  - the GLib.HashTable is created on first access
  - it creates a GXml.Attr for each Xml.Attr in the subject Xml.Node's properties

- Users modify the GLib.HashTable
  - periodically we sync the GLib.HashTable of GXml.Attrs with the underlying Xml.Node.properties
     - (like when we're stringifying (since we use libxml2's stringification functions) or saving the document)
  

New design
- store them in GXml.Document.node_dict like Elements, treating
  Xml.Attr as Xml.Node (is that really valid? alternatively,
  corresponding attr dictionary)
- eliminate syncing

GXml.Attr support requirements
- already supported through BackedNode
  - namespace prefixes
  - local_name
  - node_name
  - child_nodes (invisibly returning a NodeChildNodeList instead of an AttrChildNodeList)
  - insert_before, replace_child, remove_child, append_child, has_child_nodes; even get better error handling

- need to support
  - specified property (cur impl is a stub anyway)
  - *node_value*; this is not just node->content
    - currently we travers Xml.Attr's children via a GXml.AttrChildNodeList
      - could we replace AttrChildNodeList if we just treat Xml.Attr as an Xml.Node?
        - yes, we could use NodeChildNodeList; and we already treat Xml.Attr as an Xml.Node in 'parent_as_xmlnode'
    - still want to build like that
      - mystery:
	- if we get a GXml.Element with an attribute lang=de, and we
          change lang=en, but we don't sync yet, how do we end up with
          lang=en when we call GXml.Attr.node_value?  Shouldn't it
          still pick up lang=de from the underlying Xml.Node'
          Xml.Attr?
	- No, because GXml.Element.set_attribute creates a new
          GXml.Attr using Document.create_attribute, which creates a
          new Xml.Attr using Xml.Doc.new_prop, and then replaces the
          old GXml.Attr.  So, yes, the underlying Xml.Doc still has
          the old Xml.Attr with lang=de, but our attributes
          GLib.HashTable proxy in our GXml.Element has the new
          GXml.Attr with Xml.Attr (which is not yet attached to the
          actual underlying Xml.Node or Xml.Doc) and when we stringify
          or save to disk, we sync first.
    - we'll iterate directly over Xml.Attr's children (using a
      NodeChildNodeList though) to build our future string that we'll
      return (using a NodeList interfae for easy iteration despite
      performance penalty and to prepare for replacing libxml2 some
      day)
  - name (copy cur impl)
  - value (copy cur impl)
  - clone_node; currently we don't allow that on Attrs, and we might want to continue to not
  - to_string (copy cur impl)

GXml.Element
- set_attr
