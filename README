GXml is a GObject API that wraps around libxml2.

Compile:
  Requirements:
    * valadoc: we generate documentation using valadoc.  If it's not
      packaged for your distro (like Fedora) follow the instructions
      at:

      https://live.gnome.org/Valadoc

  autotools for a build system

  $ ./configure
  $ ./make
  $ ./make install

  You can use some common ./configure options like --prefix=$SOMEPATH to specify
  where to install it.

Test: You can run the test suite, which is gxml_test, which you may
  have installed into your $PATH.  You should actually run it from
  test/, though, as it requires .xml files that are currently just
  relatively referenced.

  $ cd test/
  $ ./gxml_test
