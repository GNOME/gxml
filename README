GXml is a GObject API that wraps around libxml2.

Version: 0.0.2

Below are instructions on how to compile libxml2

Compile:
  Requirements:
    * Python, for WAF.  You don't need to install WAF yourself, as a minimal WAF
      script is traditionally packaged with WAF as "waf"
    * a patched VAPI file libxml2: libxml-2.0.vapi.  The file can be found in
      patches/ either as a patch to be applied, or as a complete .vapi file.
      You can copy it like this, but modifying your destination path for your
      distro:

      # cp patches/libxml-2.0.vapi /usr/share/vala-0.12/vapi/

      That overwrites the .vapi already installed on your system
    * valadoc: we generate documentation using valadoc.  I don't think that it
      packaged for Fedora at least at the time of this writing, so you may have
      to obtain it following instructions at:

      https://live.gnome.org/Valadoc

  We use WAF for a build system, which is based on Python, as noted above.

  $ ./waf configure
  $ ./waf
  $ ./waf install

  You can use some common ./configure options like --prefix=$SOMEPATH to specify
  where to install it.


Test:
  You can run the test suite, which is gxml_test, which you may have installed
  into your $PATH via "./waf install" above.  Or, you can run it from build/test/

  $ cd build/test/
  $ ./gxml_test
