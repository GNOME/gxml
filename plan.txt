TODO:
C test files
gtkdoc-doclet
  look at libfolks' makefile
switch to libgee from GLib
figure out which IO operations should be cancellable (all?)

TODO:
get vala mode
figure out visibility
does vala support const? would that be good for readonly?
correct to use this_convention instead of thisConvention?
replace DOMString with string?
DOMError instead of DOMException?
what are DocumentFragments?
Attr (XML) instead of Attribute?
List<Node> instead of NodeList?
  hopefully; NodeList isn't very special
does vala allow spec'ing 'in' for params? should we bother with it?
filenames: src/GDomDocument.vala, or src/Document.vala?

enum values?
NodeEnum?
ELEMENT_NODE or ELEMENT?
do we want NamedNodeMap or something else?  GHashTable?
  NamedNodeMap: how does setNamedItem work?  just give it an AttributeNode?
  are these just used internally anyway?

interface to Node is unseemly :(

do we want to implement CharacterData or just use a string?

is there a generic GAttribute we could use instead of Attr?

what is an EntityReference and do we want one?
what is DocumentFragment and do we want it?

a few properties want to throw errors when set,
  do we want to just use methods to set/get these, or
  can vala throw an exception on a set/get?
