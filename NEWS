=============

Version 0.8.1
=============

Most changes improves GIO GLib.File use, trying to read/write any file from/to
local or remote locations.

* GXml.Document gains a backup property, set to true by default to save files
  with a backup operation
* GXml.Document.save_as() now is abstract, you should implement it.
* GXml.Document.save_as() now should not overwrite its file property

* GXml.DomException.warning() now is deprecated use exception(), now message on
  errors just printed when -D DEBUG is used at compile time
* Added Xmlx.reset_last_error() and used to cleanup errors before each operation
* Added Xmlx.context_get_last_error() to deprecate parser_context_get_last_error ()
* Added Xmlx.context_reset_last_error()
* Xmlx methods now have sanity checks asserts

* xDocument.from_stream() now use GIO internally to open any GLib.File valid object
* xDocument.from_string() now don't fails on XML with no root
* xDocument.save_to_stream()  now use GIO internally to write to any GLib.File valid object

* TwDocument.save_to() deprecated by save_as() from GXml.Document implementation

* New Translations:
  * Added German translation by                 Mario Blättermann
  * Added Brazilian Portuguese translation by   Rafael Fontenelle

=============
Version 0.8.0
=============

This new version is API compatible with 0.6 series

* Added SerializableValueList, SerializableBool, SerializableDouble, SerializableFloat,
  SerializableInt, SerializableEnum, for nullable attributes to avoid them be in
  XML file. All properties are based on new SerializableProperty interface.

* Improved documentation

* Added support for translations:
  - Added Serbian    by  Мирослав Николић
  - Added Spanish    by  Daniel Mustieles
  - Added Portuguese by  Pedro Albuquerque
  - Added Czech      by  Marek Černocký
  - Added Polish     by  Piotr Drąg
   

=============
Version 0.6.0
=============

This new version is API/ABI incompatible with 0.4 series.

Most work has been on simplifying API for Vala programers users, using interfaces and
Gee classes, allowing to create new backends based or different from libxml2. This
work allowed to re-implement existing classes without radically modify API for existing
applications and makes room to improve performance and memory usage.

News and changes are as follow:


* Added new interfaces to simplify implementing new backends for XML reading/writting,
  containers are Gee ones.

* Renamed GXml 0.4 DOM classes to prefixing a "x", to avoid conflicts with new interfaces

* GXml DOM classes, now implement new interfaces

* GXml DOM classes now implement Gee interfaces to access directly to libxml2 structures,
  reducing extra processing and memory consumption when they are referenced from permament
  on memory GObject classes. Reimplementing most other DOM classes to implement Gee classes
  in on roadmap, to reduce memory and possibly increase performance on parsing.

* Improved XML namespaces handling

* Added new TwDocument class, as pure Vala XML tree container implementation of
  new interfaces

* Implemented a 3-5 times faster XML writer using TwDocument and libxml2 xmlTextWriter.
  A new TwDocument and xmlTextReader is on roadmap, to improve parsing performance.

* Serializable framework ported to new interfaces, allowing to use different
  backends when serialize/deserialize GObjects.

* Serializable and its implementations, has gained serialization performance improvements
  using TwDocument and better namespace handling.

* Improved documentation

* Added --enable-performance-tests, just to reduce the time required to run all
  unit tests.

New interfaces makes room to convert any GObject as a GXml.Node object, making de/serialization
more transparent and possibly better performance and memory usage reduction, by avoiding
intermediate XML trees using libxml2 or TwDocument. Another plan includes, GObject mapping to XSD.
